        <h2>About Us: The Team Behind the Solution</h2>
        <!-- USAMOS ETIQUETAS <p> PARA ASEGURAR ESPACIADO ENTRE PÁRRAFOS -->
        <p>
            We are a collective of Mechanical-Electrical Engineering students united by the conviction that
            technological innovation must transcend academic boundaries and become a catalyst for societal
            progress and environmental stewardship. Our rigorous training enables us to comprehend and
            model complex systems, while our commitment to sustainability drives us to translate scientific
            knowledge into solutions with tangible impact
        </p>
        <p>
            Our work centers on the integration of satellite observations, ground-based measurements, and
            meteorological data, transforming these diverse inputs into reliable, accessible, and actionable
            intelligence for informed decision-making. Through this approach, we aim to strengthen public
            health protection, empower vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by pollution, and
            contribute to the creation of a resilient and sustainable future.
        </p>
        <p>
            We uphold purpose-driven science, ethical innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration as the
            guiding principles of our mission, convinced that addressing the environmental challenges of our era
            requires not only advanced technical expertise but also a profound sense of responsibility towards
            humanity and the planet.
